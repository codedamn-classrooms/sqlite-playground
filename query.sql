-- SQLite Playground

-- This playground contains Chinook database for writing queries. If you want to use a custom Sqlite Database, you can upload a `.db` or `.sqlite` file to use it for querying. Make sure to only have one database file in the file system.

-- You can use the browser for executing queries or use the run button to see the query output in the terminal

SELECT * FROM 'Album' 
LIMIT 10
